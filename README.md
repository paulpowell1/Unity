# Overview
This is the script for the game I made. I didn't write all of it, but I did write the enemy AI part by following a tutorial online. The part that doesn't really work but is functional. With some adjustments I could probably fix it and make the monster display a game over screen when it moves within the range of the player.

The main purpose for making this game was to get a basic understanding of C# and work with unity.
